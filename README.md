# complex_vector_multiplier_using_4_DA
As we know two complex numbers multiplication takes 4 multipliers.And we can optimize it by using DA and OBC techniques.Now it can also be done incase of vectors. So,here we took two complex vectors and we found their product in both cases of DA and OBC.we know that Yre = XreAre-XimAim Imaginary part: Yim = XreAim+XimAre.
So,for the four multiplications,we instatiated four DA bloks parallelly.
In this case we get output after K clock cycles.Throughput is high.
